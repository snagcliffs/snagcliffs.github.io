I am currently a fifth year PhD candidate in applied mathematics at the University of Washington advised by [Nathan Kutz](http://faculty.washington.edu/kutz/){:target="\_blank"} and [Steven Brunton](https://www.eigensteve.com/){:target="\_blank"}.  My research is focused on data-driven methods for dynamical systems.  Prior to UW, I studied math and physics at Washington University in St. Louis.
